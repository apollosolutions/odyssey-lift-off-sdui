# Apollo SDUI Workshop

This is the repo for the Server-Driven UI (SDUI) workshop presented at GraphQL Summit 2023. This was **not** recorded, but you can watch all other session on our [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpi1lPB6opQzUOqG3QroLLN06FF-Q_uhX).

As part of the workshop the Apollo Solutions team started a community-led [SDUI Specification](https://github.com/apollosolutions/sdui-specification). Feel free to add your ideas for how we define SDUI over in the shared spec.

## How to use this repo

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started, open up a Terminal window.

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the client up at http://localhost:3000/.

## Presenters

For future presentations, there are notes for the steps involved in the [presenter-material](/presenter-material) folder.
